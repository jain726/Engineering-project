% ENGR 132 
% Program Description 
% This program imputs the test data. Then it sets a "boundry line" this is
% a percentage of the total height. It then moves through the each
% coulumn, "i". In each column, it then moves through every value,"j". Then
% it compares the current j value to the boundry line. While the j value is
% lower than the boundry, it sets the final velocity. Then it indexs that
% velocity to the proper time. The time constant is calculated with the
% found values.
